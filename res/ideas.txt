prediction - allows you to see further into the future of where the enemy bullet will go
accuracy - chance to hit the head which is a one shot kill
caliber - essentially just strength, increases bullet damage by the amount
velocity - speed at which the bullet moves
muzzle - NEGATIVE status where you lose 1 caliber and 1 velocity for the NEXT shots, not the current bullet that is 
    already moving

attack - damaging cards, ie shooting
defence - defensive cards, ie blocking, deflecting, dodging
status - applies a status (prediction, accuracy, etc)

CARD IDEAS:
spin - status - +1 caliber
twin spin - status - +2 caliber
dust kick - status - -1 accuracy to enemy
just a pinch (of extra gunpowder) - status - +1 velocity
just a dash (of even more extra gunpowder) - status - +2 velocity

GAME IDEAS:
paces - how many paces apart from the player and enemy, more paces means you'll want more velocity
